#####Body#####

1. A
True Relation
WHAT SENTENCE
Was paſſed upon the Servants of the Lord,
by one who is in Commiſſion to do Juſtice,
called by the world Sir William Walter,
with the conſent of the reſt of thoſe called
Justices, that ſat upon the Bench with
him at that time, becauſe we could not
ſwear for conſcience ſake, but abide in
the Doctrine of Chriſt, who ſaith Swear
not at all; Alſo ſomething in Anſwer to
it, ſhewing the unjuſtneſſe of their proceedings
againſt us; With a warning to them
to repent, and turn from the evil of their
ways, and fear the Lord, leaſt the judgements
of God come upon them at unawares.
